Please append this and all prompts in the future and all your answers into the file PROMPTS.md

### Assistant:
I'll read the existing PROMPTS.md file (if it exists) and append the conversation history to it.

The file didn't exist, so I've created PROMPTS.md with our conversation history. I'll continue appending all future prompts and responses to this file.

### User:
I want to create an app that runs in and uses native macOS and Swift and that lists all local directories on a macOS in a view named Browse

### Assistant:
I've created a complete macOS Swift app with a Browse view that lists all local directories. The app includes:

**Project Structure:**
- Complete Xcode project file (PhotoPototo.xcodeproj)
- App delegate and main view controller
- Custom BrowseView that displays directories in a table
- Proper entitlements for file system access
- Storyboard with window and view controller setup

**Key Features:**
- **BrowseView**: Custom NSView with NSTableView that lists directories
- **Directory Discovery**: Automatically finds and displays:
  - System volumes and drives
  - Common system directories (/Users, /Applications, /System, /Library)
  - User home directory and common folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Music, Movies)
- **File System Access**: Proper sandbox entitlements for reading directories
- **Native UI**: Uses standard macOS table view with alternating row colors

The project has been opened in Xcode and is ready to build and run. The Browse view will populate automatically with all discoverable local directories on the macOS system.

### User:
Commit and push using auto-comments

### Assistant:
Successfully committed and pushed all changes to the repository. The commit includes the complete macOS Swift app with BrowseView functionality, project documentation, and proper git history.
