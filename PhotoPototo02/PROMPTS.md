This file tracks the prompts and answers from our Claude Code sessions.

## Session 1 - 2025-08-13

### Prompt 1
**User:** Please create a README.md and all the typical project files for Claude Code. Please continue adding all prompts and answers to the PROMPTS.md

**Claude:** I'll create a README.md and typical project files for a Claude Code project, along with a PROMPTS.md file to track our conversation.

**Actions taken:**
- Created README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and development guidelines
- Created this PROMPTS.md file to track our conversation
- Created .gitignore with common ignore patterns
- Created CLAUDE.md with project context and communication guidelines

### Prompt 2
**User:** Please add the following intructions for Claude to CLAUDE.md and place them into the suitable section: [Communication guidelines]

**Claude:** Added communication guidelines to CLAUDE.md under "Notes for Claude Code" section.

### Prompt 3
**User:** Rename the application in this folder from PhotoPototo01 to PhotoPototo02 ignoring the case

**Claude:** Renamed application from PhotoPototo01 to PhotoPototo02.

**Actions taken:**
- Searched for all case-insensitive occurrences of PhotoPototo01
- Updated 15 files with PhotoPototo01 references:
  - settings.gradle: project name
  - app/build.gradle: namespace and applicationId
  - strings.xml: app name
  - themes.xml: theme name  
  - AndroidManifest.xml: theme references
  - Java package declarations in all Kotlin files
  - Renamed package directory structure
  - Updated documentation files

### Prompt 4
**User:** Add a REQUIREMENTS.md and place all of the requirements so far and for all of the future in it

**Claude:** Created REQUIREMENTS.md with comprehensive requirements documentation.

**Actions taken:**
- Created REQUIREMENTS.md with completed and future requirements
- Organized requirements by categories: Core Functionality, UI Improvements, Performance, Advanced Features, Technical Improvements, Security, Platform Support
- Added priority levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Included development standards and testing requirements
- Documented all existing functionality and planned features

### Prompt 5
**User:** How come the project in ../PhotoPototo01 builds with a simple "claude assembleDebug" while this project PhotoPototo02 does not? Nothing has changed really apart from the name was replaced from PhotoPototo01 to PhotoPototo02

**Claude:** PhotoPototo02 had two issues preventing `claude assembleDebug` from working:

1. **Missing `gradle-wrapper.jar`** - This file is required for Gradle wrapper execution
2. **Invalid Kotlin JVM target** - Was set to version 22, which isn't supported by current Kotlin compiler

**Actions taken:**
- Generated the missing wrapper with `gradle wrapper`
- Changed JVM target from 22 to 1.8 in `app/build.gradle:27-31`
- Fixed sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility from VERSION_22 to VERSION_1_8
- Verified build now succeeds with `./gradlew assembleDebug`

### Prompt 6
**User:** Please add to the Claude instructions markdown to always add prompts and answers to the PROMPTS.md and continue doing the latter

**Claude:** Added instruction to CLAUDE.md and continuing to update PROMPTS.md.

**Actions taken:**
- Added "Always add prompts and answers to PROMPTS.md for project history tracking" to CLAUDE.md Notes for Claude Code section
- Updated this PROMPTS.md with current session
