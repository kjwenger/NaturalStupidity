### Prompt 5
**User:** How come the project in ../PhotoPototo01 builds with a simple "claude assembleDebug" while this project PhotoPototo02 does not? Nothing has changed really apart from the name was replaced from PhotoPototo01 to PhotoPototo02

**Claude:** PhotoPototo02 had two issues preventing `claude assembleDebug` from working:

1. **Missing `gradle-wrapper.jar`** - This file is required for Gradle wrapper execution
2. **Invalid Kotlin JVM target** - Was set to version 22, which isn't supported by current Kotlin compiler

**Actions taken:**
- Generated the missing wrapper with `gradle wrapper`
- Changed JVM target from 22 to 1.8 in `app/build.gradle:27-31`
- Fixed sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility from VERSION_22 to VERSION_1_8
- Verified build now succeeds with `./gradlew assembleDebug`
